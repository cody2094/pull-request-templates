This should be the default template

You shouldn't use this template. There are multiple, and you should pick the right one for the task.

Unfortunately, the only way to do that, as far as I can tell, is to use the `template=template_name.md` URL parameter.

Right now, you can pick from:

  - feature.md
  - deployment.md

So, go ahead and add `&template=feature.md` or `&template=deployment.md` to the URL bar up top
